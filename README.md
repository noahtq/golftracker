# Golf Tracker
## Description
Personal project website I made with Django. The website allows a user to create a profile, they can then record their golf scores. They can add custom courses or a pick a course from the course library. They can view other users public rounds as well as set their own round to public, or they can keep their scores private as well.
## Technology
### Languages/Framework
- Django Backend (Python)
- Unit Testing with Django Unit Test Framework
- Basic Frontend Created with HTML, CSS, JS
### Features
- Robust testing, full code coverage
- Create a profile with a custom profile picture
- Create/edit/view your rounds of golf
- Select a golf course from the course library or create your own custom course
- Set rounds to public or private. Public rounds can be viewed by other users
### Wishlist
- As this is a personal project, I created a very basic frontend for this project. At some point I could add a more aesthetically pleasing and responsive frontend
- Convert to a Django Rest API for better seperation between frontend and backend
